# DS210-Project
My Github using the Rust coding language to read from the dataset https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/data-from-the-influence-of-active-video-game-play-upon-physical-activity-and-screen-based--33694 

This code uses multiple modules to read the dataset and output graphs depicting the time spent from each participant doing physical activities compared to screen-based activities. Using the results, we can make conclusions and inferences as to how screen time affects adolescent youth as well as their development compared to previous generations when it comes to time spent doing physical activities.
